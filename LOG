Bot1 - RAD platform with treds
Goal: Self navigating bot

Project start: December 2011

Note: Battery Series = Add voltages, no change in amps
      Parallel = No change in voltage, add amps
      Watts = Amps x volts

First couple weeks of work:
Created double layer board with 2 relays on top and 2 relays on bottom to control forward and backwards movement for each motor. Sloppy DPDT relay system but it worked.
Mounted distance sensor and gained proper readings. Used floppy drive connector to attach wires to pins.
Programmed movement methods in C++
Attached battery pack: Shuanbao - 7 cells; 1.2V, 2/3A 1100mAh
Used pc 4 pin drive connector for power wires and kept stock power connector for charging.
Charger: POWER model # CL-3515; DC 8.4V250mA
Connected 9V plug to ardunio board for wireless power.
Successful self navigation on small battery charge. Navigated about 9sqr feet then battery died.
Charged battery blew a few relays and left motor.

4/25/12
Installed replacement motor on left side.
Recieved DPDT Relays x 4: AXICOM 5v DC ***HAS DATASHEET***
Finished with one control board half built but white stiff wire does not stick to solder well so set back.

4/26/12
Finished 2 boards now each with 1 DPDT relay and 1 regular relay.
Motor test.
Hooked up distance sensor again and got good input.
Road test with 2 9v, one for board and one for motors.
Errors:
Works normal but left motor is almost twice as powerful as right motor. Does a 3 foot circle on open ground.
Distance sensor sometimes loses conection on either 5v or ground thus sending a 0 for x and putting the program into the alternate route backup and turn left. Should be an easy connection problem fix.

4/29/12
Got 2 new motors: RS code: 273-223 1.5-3.0v .98A
Bad connections on right motor internally. Fixed by opening and soldering two connecting brushes then bending back to to touch the motor shaft.
Almost perfect run due but still a bit to the left. Program runs almost perfect too but looked like there was one time where the sensore messed up.
Once the left motor is fixed then get servo and place sensor on that for bigger view.
Still using 9v batt.

5/4/12
Fixed left motor but still not perfect.
Placed potentiaometer on left motor to make speeds more even. It works as a resistance that now seems too strong but makes them a bit more even.
Got servo: Futaba S3004; 5-6v power. digital signal on board
Mounted servo and distance sensor together on front.
Created program that runs servo. max spin 0-166 which looks like a full 180 degrees.
Wrote self navigation program again that looks for longest path.
Ran bot but 9v for board power isn't enough so used long USB and got feedback as well.
9v for motors dies quick too.
Time for total redesign on new platform with one or two low voltage motors on tires.
Power has been the main problem the entire time so it is time for a perminant solution that is rechargable and work for everything.

Current Hardware:
Board: Arduino UNO
Tred Motors on platform: RS code: 273-223 1.5-3.0v .98A
Distance sensor: Parallax PING - GND, 5V, Signal
servo: Futaba S3004; 5-6v power
