# Arduino Alpha Bot
The code and documentation for a self-navigating, solar-tracking, remote-controlled, 2WD robot. The project has evolved substantially since the first version on a tread-based platform. The goals are always changing.

#### Hardware
The robot is built on an Arduino UNO board and Arduino-style 2WD platform. The bells and whistles, such as IR sensors and pan-tilt motors, are always changing.

#### Software
The code is written in C++ using Arduino and other third-party libraries.
